The project is designed to monitor, capture, and analyse data flowing through computer networks. It provides deep insights into network activities by capturing and analysing packets in real time. It dissects the traffic to reveal protocol details, source and destination addresses, ports, and payload contents. The addition of the DoS extension equips the application with the ability to actively detect DoS attacks and warn the user about the activity. The project is implemented using VMs Ubuntu and Kali Linux, former being the host machine. The code is written in C using various modules & libraries such as ‘libpcap’ for packet capture and storage.
